# Tim Ferriss Mental Model Framework

A comprehensive Claude Code skill that applies Tim Ferriss's proven frameworks for optimization, learning, and decision-making.

## Quick Start

### Activate the Skill

Simply type in Claude Code:

```
/skill tim-ferriss
```

or just mention Tim Ferriss in your question:

```
"Help me learn Spanish faster using Tim Ferriss methods"
"I'm afraid to quit my job and start a business - use Tim Ferriss fear-setting"
"Apply Tim Ferriss 80/20 to my productivity"
```

## What's Inside

This skill contains **7 core Tim Ferriss frameworks**:

### 1. 🎯 DEAL Framework (4-Hour Workweek)
**Use for**: Productivity, lifestyle design, time management
- **D**efine your goals and fears
- **E**liminate the non-essential (80/20 rule)
- **A**utomate and outsource
- **L**iberate yourself (location/time freedom)

### 2. 🚀 DiSSS Meta-Learning
**Use for**: Learning any skill 10x faster
- **D**econstruction (break into learnable units)
- **S**election (focus on vital 20%)
- **S**equencing (optimal learning order)
- **S**takes (create real consequences)

### 3. 📝 CaFE Learning System
**Use for**: Retention and mastery
- **C**ompression (one-page summaries)
- **F**requency (spaced repetition)
- **E**ncoding (mnemonics and memory devices)

### 4. 😨 Fear-Setting Exercise
**Use for**: Overcoming fear-based paralysis on big decisions
- Page 1: Define, Prevent, Repair (worst cases)
- Page 2: Benefits of Action
- Page 3: Cost of Inaction (6mo, 1yr, 3yr)

### 5. ⚡ Decision-Making Heuristics
**Use for**: Quick, clear decisions
- Reversible vs. Irreversible
- "Whole body yes"
- "What if it were easy?"
- Risk/benefit analysis

### 6. ⏰ Productivity Systems
**Use for**: Daily optimization
- 5-part Morning Routine
- Priority Setting (3-5 anxieties → #1 task)
- Minimum Effective Dose (MED)
- Top-of-Funnel optimization

### 7. 📊 Core Principles
**Use for**: Everything
- 80/20 Rule (Pareto Principle)
- Parkinson's Law
- Systems over Self-Discipline
- Selective Ignorance

## Common Use Cases

### "How do I learn [skill] faster?"
→ **DiSSS + CaFE frameworks**

### "I'm afraid to [make big decision]"
→ **Fear-Setting exercise**

### "I need to be more productive"
→ **DEAL + Productivity Systems + 80/20**

### "How do I optimize [anything]?"
→ **80/20 + Minimum Effective Dose**

### "I feel overwhelmed/burned out"
→ **DEAL + Priority Setting + Selective Ignorance**

### "Should I [big life change]?"
→ **Fear-Setting + Decision Heuristics**

## How It Works

1. **You describe your problem**
2. **The agent analyzes** which framework(s) apply
3. **Walks you through** the framework step-by-step
4. **Provides actionable** Tim Ferriss-style solutions
5. **Suggests experiments** to test and iterate

## Example Session

```
You: "I want to learn piano but I'm 35 and have limited time"

Agent: Let's apply the DiSSS meta-learning framework...

[Walks through Deconstruction, Selection, Sequencing, Stakes]

Result: A specific, optimized learning plan focusing on:
- The 20% of techniques that give 80% of capability
- Optimal learning sequence to avoid early failures
- 30-minute daily practice (Minimum Effective Dose)
- Public accountability (Stakes)
```

## Tim Ferriss Philosophy

**Core Question**: "What would this look like if it were easy?"

**Approach**:
- Deconstruct complexity into simplicity
- Focus ruthlessly on the vital few (80/20)
- Find minimum effective dose, not maximum effort
- Build systems, not rely on willpower
- Test everything as experiments
- Make fear concrete to overcome it

## Framework Combinations

The skill intelligently combines frameworks:

- **Fear-Setting + DEAL** → Starting a business
- **DiSSS + 80/20** → Efficient learning
- **MED + Top-of-Funnel** → Productivity optimization
- **Fear-Setting + Decision Heuristics** → Major life changes
- **DEAL + Morning Routine + Priority Setting** → Complete life redesign
