## On Time and Life

**Life is Long If Used Wisely**

## Seneca's Life Context

**About Seneca the Younger (c. 4 BCE – 65 CE)**

Seneca lived during one of the most turbulent periods in Roman history:

- Born in Córdoba, Spain to a wealthy Roman family
- Trained in Stoic philosophy from youth
- Exiled to Corsica for 8 years by Emperor Claudius
- Later recalled to become tutor to young Nero
- Became one of Rome's wealthiest men (estimated net worth: equivalent to billions today)
- Served as advisor to Emperor Nero during his reign
- Practiced voluntary poverty despite his wealth (periodic self-denial)
- Eventually forced to commit suicide by Nero at age 69

**The Paradox of Seneca**

Seneca's life embodies a paradox that makes his philosophy particularly powerful:

- **Wealthy but practiced poverty**: Regularly gave up luxuries to train in hardship
- **Powerful but acknowledged fragility**: Advisor to emperor, yet knew he could be killed at any moment
- **Philosophical but practical**: Not an ivory tower theorist, but someone applying Stoicism in real political intrigue

**His Death**

In 65 CE, Nero ordered Seneca to commit suicide following a failed conspiracy (which Seneca may or may not have been involved in).

According to accounts, Seneca:
- Faced death calmly
- Comforted his weeping friends
- Asked, "Where are your philosophical principles?"
- Opened his veins and died slowly, discussing philosophy until the end
- His death is considered a model of Stoic courage

This is why his words carry such weight: he truly lived (and died) by his philosophy.
