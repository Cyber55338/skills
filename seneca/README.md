**Quick practice**:
- List 3 worst-case scenarios
- For each: How would I prevent it? How would I recover if it happened?

**Key quote**: *"We suffer more often in imagination than in reality."*

---

### 2. **Dichotomy of Control**
**What it is**: Separating what you can and cannot control

**When to use**: Whenever feeling frustrated, anxious, or helpless

**Quick practice**:
- Ask: "Is this within my control?"
- If NO → Accept it, redirect energy
- If YES → Take action
- If PARTIAL → Control your effort, accept outcome uncertainty

**Key quote**: *"We cannot choose our external circumstances, but we can always choose how we respond."*

---

### 3. **Memento Mori** (Remember Death)
**What it is**: Contemplating mortality to clarify priorities and live intentionally

**When to use**: When procrastinating, wasting time, or feeling scattered

**Quick practice**:
- Morning: "You may not sleep again tonight"
- Evening: "You may not wake up tomorrow"
- Ask: "If I had 1 year left, would this matter?"

**Key quote**: *"Begin at once to live, and count each separate day as a separate life."*

---

### 4. **Voluntary Discomfort**
**What it is**: Deliberately practicing hardship to build resilience and reduce dependence on comfort

**When to use**: To build mental toughness, overcome fear of loss, regular training

**Quick practice**:
- Try: Cold shower, skip a meal, sleep on floor, walk in uncomfortable weather
- Ask during: "Is this what I feared?"
- Realize: I'm more resilient than I thought

**Key quote**: *"It is in times of security that the spirit should be preparing itself for difficult times."*

---

### 5. **Time as Precious Resource**
**What it is**: Managing your finite time intentionally

**When to use**: When overwhelmed, living for others, procrastinating

**Quick practice**:
- Evening: "Did I own my time today, or did others?"
- Filter: "If I had 1 year left, would this make the list?"
- Eliminate ruthlessly

**Key quote**: *"It is not that we have a short time to live, but that we waste a lot of it."*

---

### 6. **Evening Reflection**
**What it is**: Daily self-examination to track progress and learn from mistakes

**When to use**: Every evening (5-15 minutes)

**Quick practice**:
- What bad habit did I cure today?
- What virtue did I practice?
- What could I have done better?
- Tomorrow's intention: ___

**Key quote**: *"I examine my entire day and go back over what I've done and said, hiding nothing from myself."*

### 7. **Virtue Framework**

**Quick practice**:
1. Feel the emotion (don't suppress)
2. Accept: "This happened. I can't change it."
3. Ask: "What's in my control now?"

## About Seneca

**Seneca the Younger** (c. 4 BCE – 65 CE) was a Roman Stoic philosopher, statesman, and dramatist. Despite being one of Rome's wealthiest men, he practiced voluntary poverty, faced exile, navigated dangerous imperial politics, and ultimately died by forced suicide under Nero—applying his philosophy under extreme pressure until his last breath.

His life proves these frameworks work in the real world.
