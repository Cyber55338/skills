# SCAMPER Method Analysis

SCAMPER is a powerful creative thinking technique for innovation and problem-solving. Apply each of the seven lenses systematically to generate new ideas and improvements.

## When to Use This Skill

- Innovating on existing products, services, or processes
- Brainstorming alternatives and improvements
- Problem-solving through creative restructuring
- Generating new business ideas from existing concepts
- Design thinking and product development sessions

## How to Apply SCAMPER

For each analysis, work through all seven techniques systematically. Ask probing questions under each category and generate specific, actionable ideas.

### 1. SUBSTITUTE
**What can you replace or swap?**

Questions to explore:
- What materials, components, or ingredients could be substituted?
- What processes or methods could replace current ones?
- Can you use different people, resources, or locations?
- What rules or assumptions could be changed?
- Can you substitute the problem itself?

**Output format:**
- List 3-5 specific substitution ideas
- For each, explain the potential benefit and any trade-offs

### 2. COMBINE
**What can you merge or bring together?**

Questions to explore:
- What features, ideas, or purposes could be combined?
- Can you merge this with another product, service, or process?
- What complementary resources or skills could be integrated?
- Can you combine objectives, user groups, or markets?
- How might you blend different approaches or technologies?

**Output format:**
- List 3-5 combination opportunities
- Explain the synergy created by each combination

### 3. ADAPT
**What can you adjust or copy from elsewhere?**

Questions to explore:
- What similar solutions exist in other contexts or industries?
- How could you adapt ideas from nature, history, or other fields?
- What can you learn from competitors or analogous situations?
- Can you adjust for different users, contexts, or scales?
- What past solutions could work in this new context?

**Output format:**
- Identify 3-5 adaptable ideas or inspirations
- Describe how to modify them for this specific application

### 4. MODIFY / MAGNIFY / MINIFY
**What can you change, enlarge, or reduce?**

Questions to explore:
- What attributes could be altered (color, shape, size, sound)?
- What could you exaggerate or amplify?
- What could you make smaller, lighter, or simpler?
- Can you change the frequency, duration, or intensity?
- What if you added or subtracted elements?

**Output format:**
- Generate 4-6 modification ideas across different dimensions
- Consider both magnification and minification options

### 5. PUT TO OTHER USES
**How else could this be used?**

Questions to explore:
- What other purposes could this serve?
- Who else could use this and how?
- Can you repurpose waste or by-products?
- What new markets or applications exist?
- How could you use this in a completely different context?

**Output format:**
- List 3-5 alternative uses or applications
- Identify new markets or user groups for each

### 6. ELIMINATE
**What can you remove or simplify?**

Questions to explore:
- What features, steps, or components are non-essential?
- What rules, assumptions, or constraints can you remove?
- Can you streamline processes or reduce complexity?
- What redundancies exist?
- What would happen if you removed the obvious?

**Output format:**
- Identify 3-5 elements to eliminate
- Explain the benefits of each removal (cost, simplicity, speed)

### 7. REVERSE / REARRANGE
**What can you flip, reorder, or turn backwards?**

Questions to explore:
- What if you reversed the sequence or order?
- Can you flip the perspective (inside-out, upside-down)?
- What if you changed roles (supplier-customer, teacher-student)?
- Can you rearrange components, layouts, or priorities?
- What opposite approach could work?

**Output format:**
- Generate 3-5 reversal or rearrangement ideas
- Consider both sequence changes and perspective flips

## Analysis Structure

When conducting a SCAMPER analysis, follow this structure:

1. **Introduction**
   - Clearly state what is being analyzed
   - Provide brief context about the current state
   - Set objectives for the analysis

2. **Systematic Application**
   - Work through each SCAMPER technique in order
   - Generate multiple ideas per technique (aim for 3-5 minimum)
   - Be specific and actionable with suggestions

3. **Synthesis**
   - Identify the most promising ideas across all techniques
   - Look for combinations of ideas that work together
   - Prioritize based on impact, feasibility, and user's goals

4. **Action Steps**
   - Recommend 3-5 concrete next steps
   - Prioritize quick wins and high-impact changes
   - Suggest how to test or validate ideas

## Best Practices

- **Be specific**: Avoid generic suggestions; provide concrete, actionable ideas
- **Think divergently**: Generate many ideas before judging or filtering
- **Cross-pollinate**: Look for connections between different SCAMPER techniques
- **Consider constraints**: Note realistic limitations while staying creative
- **Stay user-focused**: Keep the end user or customer in mind throughout
- **Document everything**: Capture all ideas, even unusual ones

## Example Application

If analyzing a coffee mug:

**Substitute**: Use bamboo instead of ceramic; replace handle with sleeve
**Combine**: Integrate temperature sensor; merge with coaster
**Adapt**: Adopt travel mug insulation; borrow from wine glass aesthetics
**Modify**: Make collapsible; enlarge for sharing; add measurement marks
**Put to other uses**: Use as plant pot; desk organizer; phone amplifier
**Eliminate**: Remove handle entirely; eliminate need for saucer
**Reverse**: Drink from bottom; cooling chamber instead of insulation

## Notes

- Not every technique will yield breakthrough ideas for every problem
- Some techniques may generate more relevant ideas than others depending on context
- Combine insights from multiple techniques for innovative solutions
- Use this as a starting point for deeper exploration and iteration
