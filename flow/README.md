# FLOW Framework Skill

## What is FLOW?

FLOW is an energy-based problem-solving framework that helps you work WITH natural forces instead of against them.

**Core insight**: Most methods assume more effort = better results. FLOW finds the path of least resistance while still achieving your goal.

## When to Use

Use FLOW when you're:
- Stuck despite high effort
- Experiencing constant friction/resistance
- Forcing behavior change (yourself or others)
- Fighting natural trends or forces
- Burned out from pushing too hard

## The Framework

```
F - Find Momentum      (what's already working?)
L - Locate Resistance  (where's the friction?)
O - Optimize Path      (remove friction, amplify flow)
W - Work With Forces   (channel existing energy)
```

## How to Activate

The skill automatically activates when you mention:
- "stuck", "pushing hard", "not working"
- "resistance", "friction", "burnout"
- "work smarter", "easier way"
- "hitting obstacles", "overcome friction"

Or explicitly invoke it:
```
Use the FLOW framework to analyze [your problem]
```

## What Makes FLOW Unique

Unlike existing methods (SCAMPER, 5 Whys, Six Hats), FLOW:
- Maps energy and resistance systematically
- Based on physics principles (path of least resistance)
- Emphasizes working smarter, not harder
- Only method that says "reduce effort strategically"

## Example Usage

**Problem**: Team won't adopt new tool

**Without FLOW**: Push harder, mandate usage, send reminders
**With FLOW**:
- Find momentum: Team already uses Slack happily
- Locate resistance: New tool feels like extra work
- Optimize: Build feature INTO Slack instead
- Work with forces: Meet them where they are

**Result**: 90% adoption vs. 20% through forcing
