name: flow
description: Energy-based problem solving framework that maps momentum vs resistance. Use when stuck despite high effort, facing constant friction, forcing behavior change, fighting trends, or experiencing burnout. Helps find path of least resistance while achieving goals. Triggers on "stuck", "pushing hard", "not working", "resistance", "friction", "burnout", "work smarter".

# FLOW Framework Skill

## Overview
FLOW is an energy-based problem-solving framework that helps you work WITH natural forces instead of against them. Unlike traditional methods that assume more effort = better results, FLOW maps where you're fighting friction vs. where there's natural momentum.

## Core Philosophy

**Most methods assume**: MORE EFFORT → BETTER RESULTS

**FLOW asks instead**: "Where am I fighting natural forces? Where can I work WITH existing energy?"

Think like water - find the path of least resistance while still reaching your goal.

## The FLOW Framework (4 Steps)

### F - FIND MOMENTUM
**What's already moving in the right direction without you pushing?**

Look for:
- Things that happen naturally
- Where people are already motivated
- Existing trends/patterns
- What's working (even if small)
- Natural advantages you have

### L - LOCATE RESISTANCE
**Where are you pushing hard but barely moving? Where does it feel like a fight?**

Look for:
- Tasks you procrastinate on
- Where you need constant willpower
- Frequent obstacles/setbacks
- Things that drain your energy
- Where others resist/push back

### O - OPTIMIZE PATH
**How can you remove friction AND amplify existing momentum?**

Two actions:
1. **Remove Friction** - Make resistance disappear
2. **Amplify Flow** - Make momentum stronger

Key principle: **Subtraction often beats addition**

### W - WORK WITH FORCES
**What existing force/energy can you ride instead of creating from scratch?**

Forces you can harness:
- Market trends
- Human psychology (habits, social proof, loss aversion)
- Natural rhythms (time of day, seasons)
- Network effects
- Other people's motivations
- Technological momentum

**Judo principle**: Use opponent's force against them → Use environment's force FOR you

## When to Use FLOW

Use FLOW when you experience:
- ✓ High effort but low results
- ✓ Constant resistance or friction
- ✓ Forcing behavior change (yourself or others)
- ✓ Fighting against natural trends
- ✓ Burnout from pushing too hard
- ✓ Feeling stuck despite hard work
- ✓ Need to work smarter, not harder

## What Makes FLOW Unique

| Method | Approach | Energy Model |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| SCAMPER | Add more options | Additive |
| 5 Whys | Dig deeper | Penetrative |
| Six Hats | Consider more angles | Expansive |
| Scientific Method | Test systematically | Experimental |
| **FLOW** | **Find path of least resistance** | **Redirective** |

FLOW is the first simple framework based on **ENERGY MAPPING** - no other method systematically maps forces and resistance.

## Instructions for Claude

When this skill is activated:

1. **Acknowledge** the activation of FLOW Framework

2. **Identify the problem** where user feels stuck/friction:
   - What are they trying to achieve?
   - Where are they experiencing resistance?
   - What have they already tried?

3. **Apply the 4-step FLOW process**:

   **F - Find Momentum**:
   - Ask: "What's already working, even if small?"
   - Identify natural advantages, existing trends, motivated actors
   - List 2-5 momentum sources

   **L - Locate Resistance**:
   - Ask: "Where does it feel like pushing a boulder uphill?"
   - Identify energy drains, obstacles, friction points
   - Common patterns: forcing behavior, fighting market, working against strengths
   - List 2-5 resistance points

   **O - Optimize Path**:
   - For each resistance: How can we remove or route around it?
   - For each momentum: How can we amplify or accelerate it?
   - Find the path of least resistance
   - Emphasize: Often subtraction beats addition

   **W - Work With Forces**:
   - Identify larger forces at play (market, culture, psychology, nature)
   - Ask: "What if we stopped fighting and redirected instead?"
   - Show how to channel existing energy vs. creating from scratch

4. **Provide concrete examples**:
   - Use analogies (water flowing, judo, physics)
   - Show before/after comparisons
   - Give specific action steps

5. **Common mistake warnings**:
   - Not confusing "easy" with "lazy" (strategic effort vs wasted effort)
   - Not ignoring ALL resistance (strategic vs wasteful friction)
   - Not giving up too early (distinguish between types of resistance)

6. **Output format**:
```
## FLOW Analysis

**Problem**: [Clear statement]

### F - FIND MOMENTUM
What's already flowing:
- [Momentum 1]
- [Momentum 2]
- [Momentum 3]

### L - LOCATE RESISTANCE
What's blocking/draining:
- [Resistance 1]
- [Resistance 2]
- [Resistance 3]

### O - OPTIMIZE PATH
Remove friction:
- [Action 1]
- [Action 2]

Amplify flow:
- [Action 1]
- [Action 2]

Path of least resistance:
[Describe the easier path]

### W - WORK WITH FORCES
Existing forces to channel:
- [Force 1]: [How to ride it]
- [Force 2]: [How to ride it]

If we stop fighting and redirect:
[Describe the shift in approach]

7. **Key principles to emphasize**:
   - Like water: don't fight the mountain, flow around
   - Strategic effort vs. wasted effort
   - Subtract friction before adding more effort
   - Channel existing energy vs. creating from scratch
   - Work WITH human nature, not against it

## Integration with Other Skills

FLOW works well with:
- **5 Whys**: Use 5 Whys to find problem → Use FLOW to find easiest solution path
- **SCAMPER**: Use SCAMPER to generate options → Use FLOW to find which has least resistance
- **Planning Mode**: Use FLOW first to map energy → Then plan strategically where there's momentum
- **MetaCognitive Flow**: For deep reasoning about why resistance exists and where forces come from

## Success Indicators

You've successfully applied FLOW when:
- User sees a path that requires LESS effort, not more
- Solution works WITH existing forces, not against them
- Friction points are removed or routed around
- Natural momentum is identified and amplified
- User feels relief ("Why didn't I see this before?")

## Example Triggers

Activate FLOW when user says:
- "I'm stuck even though I'm working really hard"
- "This feels like pushing a boulder uphill"
- "Nothing's working no matter what I try"
- "My team keeps resisting this change"
- "I'm burned out from trying so hard"
- "There must be an easier way"
- "Help me work smarter, not harder"
- "I keep hitting obstacles"
- "How do I overcome this friction?"

## Meta Notes

FLOW represents a paradigm shift from "effort-maximizing" to "friction-minimizing" thinking. The goal is not to avoid all hard work, but to ensure effort is STRATEGIC - applied where it multiplies rather than where it's wasted fighting natural forces.

Like a river reaching the ocean: it doesn't fight the mountain, it finds the path around. Same destination, fraction of the energy.
