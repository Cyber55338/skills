# FLOW Framework - Quick Reference

## One-Line Summary
**Work WITH forces, not against them - find the path of least resistance to your goal**

---

## The 4 Steps

```
F - FIND MOMENTUM      (what's already moving?)
L - LOCATE RESISTANCE  (where's the friction?)
O - OPTIMIZE PATH      (remove friction, amplify flow)
W - WORK WITH FORCES   (channel existing energy)
```

---

## Quick Worksheet

```
Problem: _________________________________________

F - What's already working (even if small):
   • _________________________________________
   • _________________________________________

L - Where I'm pushing hard but stuck:
   • _________________________________________
   • _________________________________________

O - Remove friction:
   • _________________________________________

   Amplify flow:
   • _________________________________________

   Easiest path: ____________________________

W - Existing force I can ride:
   • _________________________________________

   If I stop fighting: ______________________

## When to Use FLOW

✓ High effort, low results
✓ Constant friction/resistance
✓ Forcing behavior change
✓ Fighting trends/nature
✓ Burnout from pushing too hard
✓ Feeling stuck despite hard work

---

## Core Principles

🌊 **Be like water** - Don't fight the mountain, flow around it

⚡ **Strategic effort** - Work where it multiplies, not where it's wasted

➖ **Subtraction wins** - Remove friction before adding more effort

🔄 **Channel energy** - Redirect existing forces vs. creating from scratch

🎯 **Same goal, easier path** - Destination unchanged, route optimized

---

## Common Mistake Warnings

❌ Confusing "easy" with "lazy"
✓ Strategic effort vs. wasted effort

❌ Ignoring ALL resistance
✓ Strategic (builds muscle) vs. Wasteful (burns energy)

❌ Giving up too early
✓ Distinguish resistance types first

## Forces You Can Harness

- Market trends
- Human psychology (habits, social proof, loss aversion)
- Natural rhythms (circadian, seasonal)
- Network effects
- Gravity of large systems
- Other people's motivations
- Technological momentum
- Cultural currents
- Biological tendencies

## FLOW vs Other Methods

| Method | What it does | What FLOW adds |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| SCAMPER | Generates ideas | Shows which has least resistance |
| 5 Whys | Finds problem | Maps energy landscape |
| Six Hats | Explores angles | Reveals friction points |
| Lean Startup | Tests assumptions | Finds natural momentum |

**FLOW is the ONLY method that systematically maps energy and resistance**

## Visual Metaphor

```
BEFORE FLOW          AFTER FLOW

    ↑ GOAL               ↑ GOAL
    |                    |
 ╱█████╲              ╱~~~~~╲
(boulder)            (flowing)
    |                    |
    ● YOU                ● YOU

Pushing uphill       Flowing around
High effort          Low effort
Low progress         High progress
```

---

## Decision Tree

```
Feeling stuck?
  ↓
High effort, low results?
  ↓
Is this strategic resistance?
  ├─ YES → Keep going (builds muscle)
  └─ NO → Apply FLOW ✓
      ↓
      Find what's already flowing
      Find what's creating friction
      Remove friction, amplify flow
      Ride existing forces
```

## Pattern Recognition

In every FLOW success story:

1. **Momentum exists** (something already working)
2. **Resistance is costly** (draining energy)
3. **Subtraction helps** (removing beats adding)
4. **Forces are real** (trends, biology, culture)
5. **Redirection wins** (channel vs. create)

---

## One-Question Test

**"Am I pushing a boulder uphill, or flowing like water?"**

If boulder → Use FLOW
If water → Keep going

---

## Judo Principle Applied

**Traditional problem-solving**: Meet force with force (push harder)

**FLOW approach**: Use force against itself (redirect energy)

Example:
- Team resists new tool → Don't force adoption
- Team loves existing tool → Build INTO existing tool

---

## Physics Analogy

**Energy follows path of least resistance**
- Lightning finds easiest path to ground
- Water flows around obstacles
- Heat moves from hot to cold

**Your effort should too** - channel, don't fight

---

## Remember

> "Like water reaching the ocean - it doesn't fight the mountain, it finds the path around."
>
> **Same destination. Fraction of the energy.**

---

## Success Indicator

You've applied FLOW correctly when you feel:

**"Why didn't I see this before?!"**

The easier path was always there - FLOW helped you see it.
