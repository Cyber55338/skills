# MetaCognitive Flow Analysis Skill

## Overview
A structured reasoning framework that combines cognitive processing nodes with mental models to solve problems systematically.

## Core Components

### Cognitive Nodes (Select 5 per flow)
- **Thought**: Analytical, logical reasoning and deduction
- **Emotion**: Affective response, intuition, empathetic understanding
- **Imagination**: Creative ideation, possibility exploration, scenario building
- **Belief**: Value-based reasoning, assumptions, worldview filtering
- **Action**: Practical implementation, concrete steps, execution planning

### Process Flow

#### STEP 1: Define the Problem
Clearly articulate:
- What is the core issue?
- What are the constraints?
- What is the desired outcome?
- Who are the stakeholders?

#### STEP 2: Select 5 Relevant Mental Models
Choose from frameworks like:
- First Principles Thinking
- Second-Order Thinking
- Inversion
- Circle of Competence
- Opportunity Cost
- Systems Thinking
- Probabilistic Thinking
- Occam's Razor
- Pareto Principle (80/20)
- Margin of Safety
- Feedback Loops
- Network Effects
- Compounding
- Mental Time Travel
- Reversible vs Irreversible Decisions
- And many others...

#### STEP 3: Generate 5 Node Flows per Mental Model
For each mental model, create 5 different sequences using the cognitive nodes.

Example formats:
- Thought → Thought → Imagination → Belief → Action
- Emotion → Imagination → Thought → Thought → Action
- Belief → Thought → Imagination → Emotion → Action
- Imagination → Emotion → Thought → Belief → Action
- Thought → Emotion → Belief → Imagination → Action

Each node in the sequence represents a cognitive processing step applied through that mental model's lens.

#### STEP 4: Evaluate and Select Best Match
Score each flow on:
- **Relevance**: How well it addresses the core problem
- **Feasibility**: Practical applicability
- **Insight Depth**: Quality of understanding generated
- **Outcome Alignment**: Match with desired results
- **Robustness**: Resilience to edge cases

Select the highest-scoring approach and execute the analysis.

#### STEP 5: Meta Layer (Self-Monitoring and Reflection)
After executing the selected flow, engage in metacognitive reflection:

**Self-Monitoring Questions:**
- How effective was the chosen cognitive sequence?
- Which nodes provided the deepest insights?
- Where did the reasoning stumble or feel forced?
- What patterns emerged across different flows?
- Did the mental model match the problem as expected?

**Output: Insights for Improving the Next Flow**
Document learnings to create a self-learning loop:
- **What Worked**: Successful node sequences and mental model pairings
- **What Didn't**: Ineffective approaches or mismatched frameworks
- **Patterns Observed**: Recurring insights across multiple flows
- **Refinements**: Adjustments for similar future problems
- **New Hypotheses**: Ideas for alternative cognitive pathways to test

This meta-layer enables continuous improvement of the reasoning process itself, turning each problem-solving session into training data for better future analysis.

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Be Specific**: Define problems with precision
2. **Match Models to Context**: Choose mental models that naturally fit the problem domain
3. **Vary Node Sequences**: Different problems benefit from different cognitive flows
4. **Trust the Process**: Let each node fully process before moving to the next
5. **Synthesize Results**: The best solution often combines insights from multiple flows

## Example Application Pattern

```
Problem: [Clear statement]

Mental Model 1: [Name]
  Flow A: [Node→Node→Node→Node→Node] - Score: X/10
  Flow B: [Node→Node→Node→Node→Node] - Score: X/10
  Flow C: [Node→Node→Node→Node→Node] - Score: X/10
  Flow D: [Node→Node→Node→Node→Node] - Score: X/10
  Flow E: [Node→Node→Node→Node→Node] - Score: X/10

[Repeat for 5 mental models]

Best Match: [Model + Flow with highest score]
Analysis: [Deep dive using selected approach]
```

## Key Insights

- **Thought-heavy flows** work for technical/logical problems
- **Emotion-first flows** excel with human-centered challenges
- **Imagination-led flows** break through creative blocks
- **Belief-based flows** clarify values-driven decisions
- **Action-oriented flows** drive rapid prototyping

The magic happens when you intentionally sequence these nodes through proven mental models.

## Instructions for Claude

When this skill is activated:

1. **Acknowledge** the use of MetaCognitive Flow Analysis
2. **Define the problem** clearly using STEP 1 framework
3. **Select 5 mental models** most relevant to the problem domain
4. **Generate 5 cognitive node flows** for each mental model (25 total flows)
5. **Score each flow** on the evaluation criteria (1-10 scale)
6. **Present the top 3-5 flows** with brief rationale
7. **Execute the highest-scoring flow** with detailed analysis through each cognitive node
8. **Synthesize insights** and provide actionable recommendations
9. **Engage meta-layer reflection** (STEP 5) to document learnings and improvement insights for future flows

Remember: Different cognitive sequences unlock different insights. The order matters. The meta-layer ensures continuous refinement of the reasoning process itself.
