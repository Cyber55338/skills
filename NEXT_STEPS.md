## 🎯 Immediate Actions (Do These Now!)

### Step 1: Install Plugin Marketplaces

Open a new Claude Code conversation and run:

```
/plugin marketplace add anthropics/skills
/plugin marketplace add obra/superpowers-marketplace
```

**What this does:** Adds official Anthropic and community plugin sources

### Step 2: Install Core Plugins

```
/plugin install docx@anthropics/skills
/plugin install xlsx@anthropics/skills  
/plugin install pptx@anthropics/skills
/plugin install pdf@anthropics/skills
/plugin install superpowers@superpowers-marketplace
```

**What you get:** Professional document generation + development superpowers

### Step 3: Test Your First Skill

Start a new conversation and say:

```
"I need to create a PRD for a mobile fitness app"
```

**Expected result:**
- bmad-prd Skill auto-activates
- Guides you through requirements gathering
- Generates professional PRD document

→ Checks for story
→ Loads Story Context
→ Implements with TDD
→ 100% test coverage
```

### Example 3: Status Check
```
You: "What's the status of my project?"

→ bmad-workflow-status activates
→ Analyzes completed work

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Natural Language Works
You don't need to memorize commands. Just talk naturally:
- ✅ "I need a PRD"
- ✅ "Let's build this feature"
- ✅ "What should we do next?"

### Tip 2: Skills Auto-Activate
The system detects your intent from keywords:
- "PRD" → bmad-prd
- "implement" → bmad-dev
- "architect" → bmad-architect (when ready)

### Tip 3: Slash Commands Still Work
If you prefer explicit commands:
- `/pm` → Product Manager menu
- `/dev` → Developer menu
- `/prd` → PRD workflow

Both approaches work! Use what feels natural.

### Tip 4: Check Status Anytime
```
"What's the workflow status?"
```
Get instant insight into project state and next steps.
